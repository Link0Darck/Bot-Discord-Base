# Bot-Discord-Base

I present you a base of bot Discord in JS with Discord.js it is besides the same base which I used for my bot [Inari](https://inari.neko-world.ovh/).

the requirements :

- [Link to Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- package screen (if you want to run the bot on linux)
- Have the necessary knowledge

How it works :

You install node.js and you configure the config.json you only have the ping command after you to code the rest.

Good luck!
